# Ajou-Parser

Ajou-Parser is a high-performance, asynchronous web scraper/parser for Ajou University's courses, notices, meals, and people search. It's built with Rust, harnessing the power of the `reqwest` and `chromiumoxide` (Automated browser like selenium) libraries to provide a fast and reliable data extraction tool.
